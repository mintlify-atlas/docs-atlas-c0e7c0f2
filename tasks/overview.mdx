title: Workflow Tasks Overview
description: Overview of task types available in Lemline workflows
---

Tasks are the building blocks of Lemline workflows. Each task represents a discrete unit of work that can perform operations, control flow, manipulate data, or interact with external systems.

## Task Categories

Lemline supports several categories of tasks:

### Flow Control Tasks

Control the execution flow of your workflow:

- **[Do](/tasks/do)** - Execute tasks sequentially
- **[Fork](/tasks/fork)** - Execute tasks in parallel
- **[Switch](/tasks/switch)** - Conditional branching
- **[For](/tasks/for)** - Iterate over collections

### Activity Tasks

Interact with external systems and services:

- **[Call](/tasks/call)** - Invoke external services (HTTP, OpenAPI, gRPC, AsyncAPI)
- **[Run](/tasks/run)** - Execute containers, scripts, shells, or workflows

### Data Tasks

Manipulate and transform data:

- **[Set](/tasks/set)** - Create or modify variables

### Event Tasks

Handle event-driven workflows:

- **[Listen](/tasks/listen)** - Wait for external events
- **[Emit](/tasks/emit)** - Publish events

### Error Handling Tasks

Manage errors and retries:

- **[Try/Catch](/tasks/try-catch)** - Handle errors and implement retries
- **[Raise](/tasks/raise)** - Explicitly raise errors

### Timing Tasks

Control timing and delays:

- **[Wait](/tasks/wait)** - Pause workflow execution

## Common Task Properties

All tasks support these common properties:

### Conditional Execution

```yaml
- myTask:
    if: "${ .condition == true }"
    # ... task configuration
```

### Input Transformation

```yaml
- myTask:
    input:
      from: "${ .specificField }"
    # ... task configuration
```

### Output Transformation

```yaml
- myTask:
    output:
      as: "${ { result: .data } }"
    # ... task configuration
```

### Flow Control

```yaml
- myTask:
    then: nextTaskName  # or 'continue', 'exit', 'end'
    # ... task configuration
```

### Timeout

```yaml
- myTask:
    timeout:
      after: PT30S  # ISO 8601 duration
    # ... task configuration
```

## Task Naming

Each task must have a unique name within its scope:

```yaml
do:
  - fetchData:      # Task name
      call: http
      # ...
  - processData:    # Another unique task name
      set:
        # ...
```

## Data Flow

By default, the output of one task becomes the input to the next task in a sequence:

```yaml
do:
  - step1:
      set:
        value: "Hello"
  - step2:
      set:
        message: "${ .value + ' World' }"  # Accesses output from step1
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive task names** - Make task names clear and meaningful
2. **Keep tasks focused** - Each task should have a single responsibility
3. **Handle errors appropriately** - Use Try/Catch for operations that might fail
4. **Set timeouts** - Prevent workflows from hanging indefinitely
5. **Transform data explicitly** - Use Set tasks when data transformation logic is complex
6. **Document complex logic** - Add metadata or comments to explain non-obvious task behavior

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Flow Control Tasks](/tasks/do) for sequential execution
- Explore [Activity Tasks](/tasks/call) for external integrations
- Understand [Error Handling](/tasks/try-catch) for robust workflows
