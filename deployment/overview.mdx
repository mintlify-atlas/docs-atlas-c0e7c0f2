title: Deployment Overview
description: Deploy Lemline workflow runners on your infrastructure
---

Lemline runs **on top of your existing infrastructure**. Deploy stateless Lemline runners that connect to your event broker and database to orchestrate workflows with minimal overhead.

## Architecture

Lemline uses an event-driven architecture where workflow state is carried within broker messages, minimizing database load and enabling horizontal scalability:

- **Event Broker** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, PGMQ) transports workflow state through messages
- **Database** (PostgreSQL, MySQL) is used only when strictly necessary: timers, retries, and checkpoints
- **Stateless Lemline Runners** orchestrate workflows, make calls to your services, and scale horizontally with no coordination overhead

## Deployment Options

### Docker

The fastest way to deploy Lemline is using the official Docker image. The multi-stage Dockerfile builds a JVM-based runtime with minimal dependencies.

- Pre-built image with JRE 17
- Multi-stage build for optimal layer caching
- Non-root user for security
- Configurable via environment variables or mounted config files

### Native Image

For production environments requiring minimal resource footprint and fast startup times, Lemline can be compiled to a native binary using GraalVM.

- Startup in milliseconds
- Reduced memory footprint
- Perfect for containerized and serverless environments
- Platform-specific builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Kubernetes

Deploy Lemline on Kubernetes for enterprise-grade orchestration with automatic scaling, rolling updates, and high availability.

- StatefulSet or Deployment configurations
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- ConfigMaps for configuration management
- Readiness and liveness probes

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Supported Databases

- **PostgreSQL** (recommended)
- **MySQL**
- **H2** (development only)

### Supported Message Brokers

- **Kafka** (recommended for high throughput)
- **RabbitMQ** (recommended for ease of setup)
- **PGMQ** (PostgreSQL-based, minimal infrastructure)

<Note>
PGMQ uses PostgreSQL for both database storage and messaging, requiring no additional broker infrastructure.
</Note>

### Resource Requirements

**Minimum (Development):**
- 512 MB RAM
- 1 CPU core
- 1 GB disk space

**Recommended (Production):**
- 2-4 GB RAM per runner
- 2-4 CPU cores per runner
- 10 GB disk space for database

## Configuration

Lemline can be configured using:

1. **YAML configuration file** - Recommended for most deployments
2. **Environment variables** - Useful for containerized deployments
3. **System properties** - Alternative for JVM-based deployments

Configuration priority: System Properties > Environment Variables > Configuration File

## Observability

Lemline includes built-in observability features:

- **Micrometer Metrics** - Prometheus-compatible metrics for workflows, retries, and failures
- **Health Checks** - Ready and live endpoints integrated into Quarkus runtime
- **Structured Logging** - JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs

## Horizontal Scaling

Lemline runners are completely stateless and can be scaled horizontally with no coordination overhead:

- No sticky sessions required
- No shared state between runners
- Load balancing handled by the message broker
- Scale up/down based on message queue depth
